	Here's what happened in the climax of movie “The Dark Knight”.
	<br><br>

	The villain forces people to two ships. Each ship is given a remote to blow up the other ship.
	If both ships do not use the remote, villain will blow both the ships. <b>So kill or be killed.</b>
	<br><br>
	What will you do in this situation? <br>
	Lets see what is the best response by looking at a similar game.

	<b>THE GAME OF TRUST</b>
	<br>
	You have one choice.
	In front of you is a machine: if you put a coin in the machine,
	the <i>other player</i> gets three coins – and vice versa.
	You both can either choose to COOPERATE (put in coin), or CHEAT (don't put in coin).
</p>

<p id="oneoff_0_btm">
	<b>Let's say the other player cheats, and doesn't put in a coin.</b><br>
	What should you do?
</p>

<p id="oneoff_1_cheated">
	Exactly! Why let opponent take advantage of you?
</p>

<p id="oneoff_1_cooperated">
	Sadly, your opponent took advantage of you.
</p>

<p id="oneoff_1_top">
	If you cooperate &amp; he cheats, you lose a coin while he gains three. (score: -1 vs +3)
	However, if you both cheat, neither of you gain or lose anything. (score: 0 vs 0)
	<b>Therefore: you should CHEAT.</b>
</p>

<p id="oneoff_1_btm">
	<b>But let's say the other player cooperates, and puts in a coin.</b><br>
	What should you do now?
</p>

<p id="oneoff_2_cheated">
	Wow, that's mean... and also the correct answer!
</p>

<p id="oneoff_2_cooperated">
	Sure, seems like the right thing to do... <b>OR IS IT??</b>
</p>

<p id="oneoff_2_top">
	Because if you both cooperate, you both give up a coin to gain three. (score: +2 vs +2)
	But if you cheat &amp; he cooperates, you gain three coins at their cost of one. (score: +3 vs -1)
	<b>Therefore: you "should" still CHEAT.</b>
</p>

<p id="oneoff_2_btm">
	And <i>that's</i> our dilemma.
	Trust is nice, but it can let others pull you down as you try helping them.
	Sometimes, distrust is rational!
	But now, what happens if we play this game...
